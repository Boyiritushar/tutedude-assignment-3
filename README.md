# Factorial Calculator

This Python script calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer entered by the user using a recursive function.

## How It Works

- The script prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer.
- It validates the input to ensure it is not negative.
- It calculates the factorial using a recursive function `factorial(n)`.
- Finally, it prints the factorial value.


# Math Functions Calculator

This Python script prompts the user to enter a number and then calculates three mathematical values using the math module: the square root, the natural logarithm, and the sine of the number.

How it works:

* The user inputs a number.
* The script calculates the square root of the number.
* It calculates the natural logarithm (base *e*) of the number.
* It calculates the sine of the number (in radians).
* Finally, it prints all the results.

Important notes:

* The input number should be positive for the square root and logarithm calculations because these functions do not accept zero or negative numbers.
* The sine function can handle any real number input.
* Entering zero or a negative number may cause the program to raise an error.
